The project status is only important, if you want to upload resources to Transifex (Attention: you need specific permissions on Transifex for this operation).

Depending on this type the folder structure of the language package will be created (see also [Resources](2administration/resources.md)).

Possible types:

   * Not defined
   * Upload from module: select this type, if you want to read the language files of a specific module, existing in current XOOPS environment
   * XOOPS Core: select this type, if you want to upload the XOOPS Core languange files
