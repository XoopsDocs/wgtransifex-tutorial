_Figure 2: Import and Export of your current database \(Admin side\)_

The dashboard provides an overview about current content of your modulue.

When you start working with XOOPS wgTranisfex, you can import our sample definition of a module. This will help you to understand the settings of a module, its tables, and individual fields.

If you create a very cool module, you can export the database and share with others, so they can import it and improve it or customize for their individual needs.
